file types
----------
p_reduced4.info - gives info about construction of poly file WRT trees
p_reduced4.poly - poly file defining the reduced polytope
p_reduced4.sim_raw - simulation showing fraction of hits on each cone
p_reduced4.sim_out - simulation after processing by cone_compatibility
p_reduced4.trees - the trees. multiplicity is the collection of trees for a given cone
p_reduced4.poly.00.poly - the 0th cone for the reduced polytope. has positive orthant constraints
<anything>.poly.out - what comes out of dexml_poly.py.


simulation
----------
0. run reduced to make the reduced cones

1. run dexml_poly.py <reduced poly file> GRAPH to get the graph

2. simulate, finding the fraction of hits in each cone.
   this is done by simulate_cones, and outputs in .sim_raw

3. for each cone, calculate the number of splits in the lower tree that are compatible with all the splits associated with that cone
   (there are some details about multiple trees per cone, but it's all the same)
   call that number NC
   make a table which is
   NC   \t   total fraction of hits for all cones with the given NC value
   this is done by cone_compatibility, and output is .sim_out


looking at structure of cones
-----------------------------
0 and 1 as above

2. run write_pos_cones on the resulting .poly.out file, getting lots of files like p_reduced4.poly.00.poly

3. run dexml_poly.py <cone file> VERTICES to get the vertices of the cones


one run
-------
make (make reduced)
make go
mkdir analysis
mv p_reduced* analysis
cd analysis/
dexml_poly.py p_reduced[45].poly GRAPH
mkdir sim
mkdir cone_struct
../write_pos_cones.native p_reduced[45].poly.out
mv *poly*poly cone_struct/
cd analysis/
cp *.poly.out *.trees sim/
cd sim/
../../simulate_cones.native -e 5 p_reduced4
../../simulate_cones.native -e 5 p_reduced5
../../cone_compatibility.native p_reduced4
../../cone_compatibility.native p_reduced5
